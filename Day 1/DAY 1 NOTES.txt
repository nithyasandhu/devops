Docker is a platform that provides virtual containers on which an application can be deployed independent of the underlying OS of the server. Further the container can be created from a replica called docker image which contains all the dependencies and can run on any OS that has docker engine, with similar results.


VIRTUALIZATION:
Virtualization is the process of sharing hardware resources across several virtually isolated and mutually independent systems. It is achieved by using a hypervisor which acts as a bridge between the Operating System of each of the virtual machines and the underlying hardware.
Applications in virtual environments run on a host operating system on top of the hypervisor.
